# WARNING

The specific purpose and general architecture is still not defined.
 
 It is far from being usable at this time, but the idea is to implement a game engine, see what works well,
 what should be refactored and what should become its own library (which should be pushed on crates.io).
 
 If you are looking for a promising Rust game engine or game engine resources, just take a look at :
